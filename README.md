## 🚀Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Ensure that `Node.js` and `MySQL` are installed on your machine.

### Installation

1. **Clone this repository:**

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/dvjsharma/Drawn2Shoe.git
    cd Drawn2Shoe
    ```

2. **Install client dependencies:**

    ```bash
    cd client
    npm install
    ```

3. **Install server dependencies:**

    ```bash
    cd ../server
    npm install
    ```

4. **Create a configuration file:**

    Create a file named `config.env` in the server folder and simply copy the content of `.env.example` into it.

5. **Setting up the Database:**

    Open XAMPP (or any other SQL Db service) and start the Apache and MySQL services. Find and import the database from [here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1qShqZpEGcdhVmZ7zzAar-tBwhPFomNWW/view?usp=sharing). Make sure to name it as `drawn2shoe`.

    <i>NOTE: if you have custom configuration for XAMPP, don't forget to change Db config in `server/data/database.js`</i>

6. **Running the Frontend:**

    ```bash
    cd ../client
    npm run dev
    ```

7. **Running the Backend:**

    Open another terminal in the folder, and make sure XAMPP (or any other SQL Db service) is running in the background.

    ```bash
    cd ../server
    node server.js
    ```

After completing these steps, you should have the Drawn2Shoe application up and running on your local machine. 🎉
